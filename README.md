## **Project Overview**
Eat Well is a recipe sharing site, where users can create, share and edit recipes. 

This site has been developed to appeal to people of all walks of life, the site has a simple design which will mean that it will appeal to a wider audience and keeps the focus on the details of the recipes. 

For this project I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python to build the site making sure that it is fully responsive to the interaction of the user on what ever device.
